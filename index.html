        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, 
            and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the 
            guidance of educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has
             a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. </p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is primarily managed by state-run public education system, which fall under the command of the government
             at three levels: federal, state and local. Under various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act,
              2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools 
              in India is 7:5. Major policy initiatives in Indian education are numerous.  </p>

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">Lets Grow Together</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Poorly resourced public schools which suffer from high rates of teacher absenteeism may have encouraged the rapid 
            growth of private (unaided) schooling in India, particularly in urban areas. Private schools divide into two types: recognised and unrecognised schools. 
            Government ‘recognition’ is an official stamp of approval and for this a private school is required to fulfil a number of conditions, though hardly any
             private schools that get ‘recognition’ actually fulfil all the conditions of recognition.</p>
